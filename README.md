# twogfing

twofing is a daemon which runs in the background and recognizes two-finger gestures performed on a touchscreen and converts them into mouse and keyboard events. This way, such gestures can be used in almost all existing applications (even ones where you wouldnâ€™t expect it, like Wine applications) without having to modify them.
